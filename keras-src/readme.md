#Coode bases of Mimicry embedded data training

Here various neural network architectures were trained using ZedMate mimicry embedded data. Different architectures resulted in deferent classification performance.
Data preparation, mimicry ebedding pipelines are available as KNIME workflow pipelines unde ../knime-workflows

# CapsNet

CapsNet layers code has been largely based on MIT licensed code completed by Xifeng Guo, E-mail: `guoxifeng1990@163.com`, Github: `https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras`.
Custome code for MNIST, optimized hyper parameters has been develop to fir the implementation.

# DropConnect

DropConnect layers are based on Keras community contributions https://github.com/keras-team/keras-contrib.
