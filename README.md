# ZedMate Readme

ZedMate is a suite of plugins aimed multi-channel intensity quantification.

The main plugin called ZedMate is aimed at particle detection and intensity quantification in 3D multi-channel images. The main detector is based on the TrackMate Laplacian of Gaussian engine. Most contemporary microscopy modalities are anisotropic in their XYZ-resolution. Specifically Z-resolution is inferior to XY. That's why it is convenient to think of particle detection in 3D as a 2D particle detection + tracking problem. ZedMate manuscript is currently in preparation

# ZedMate Plugin on ImageJ.net
Further description of the plugin is also available on [ImageJ Wiki](https://imagej.net/ZedMate)

# Datasets produced with ZedMate Plugin
We have recently produced an example of the datasets produced using the mimicry embedding feature of ZedMate. Here a single virus particle dataset is embedded to resemble MNIST hand-written digits dataset: [Virus-MNIST](https://github.com/ayakimovich/virus-mnist)
